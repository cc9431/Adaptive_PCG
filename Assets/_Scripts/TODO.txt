bigdeal:
Finish Data Logging: log all raw data every 30 seconds and upon death
Player Matching: algorithm that takes in "post object data" and uses this to change generation rates

note:
Generation: Only level 1 at the beginning. Player must gain some required points with any type, then that type can generate higher levels
// Done? Reset should stay within the current scene, not reload it

smalldeal:

Jasmine's Notes

minimum time?
maximum time?
unitil minimum time is up, restart automatically upon death
after minimum time ends, offer option to continue or quit
how long are you going to tell the test takers that this test will take?
    make this total time much longer than the minimum playing time
ask people why they stopped (bored, have somewhere to be, died, frustrated, etc.)
survey question: how often do you play games? do you like video games? etc.
