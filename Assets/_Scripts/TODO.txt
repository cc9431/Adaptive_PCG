//:::Add tutorial for before testing round. Player is in an arena with the interactables. Interactables have descriptions hovering over them. Player can drive around and test out the controls of the car.
//:::For next time: 5 pages on what I have done so far.

Jasmine's Survey Questions:

on a scale from 1 - 10 how [bored, frustrated, excited, tired...] were you while playing?
how often do you play games? do you like video games?

//:::Start A and Start B should do different things!
//:::Tutorial Level:
    //:::Max Speed Lower, Objects spawned every 4 tiles
//:::Finish Data Logging: Create JSON file for logging all levels
//::Player Matching: Through trial and error, find expected value for average stat of each interactable. For Example, RampL0 should have 25air, 5back, 10max, 60points.
    //::After dividing the average of all the RampL0, RampL1, and RampL2 stats by their respective expected values, apply weights to the resulting numbers based on how much I think each stat should matter (Higher than expected point gain should be rewarded more over higher than expected max-speed frame number, because high max-speed frames is easier than high point gain). After this, calculate how Ramps in general compare to the rest of the types, by applying this same process to each type and adding all results together, then dividing each by the sum. Use the resulting numbers to shift preference values.
        //::Weights in order of size: Points, Back, Air, Max
//::Change style of preference picking, instead of values that divide the styles and levels, use percents and sum ontop of the previous to get the effect of what I am doing now
//::Total number of incounters should also be applied to the weighing
//:Finish UI buttons
//::Different divisors for keyboard and controller
//:FinalData.csv
    //:Printing avgAir twice
    //:ID should be both type and level
//::Horizontal takes A D left and right. Fix this.
