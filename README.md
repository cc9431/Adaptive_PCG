# Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in Procedural Content Generation (PCG)

This is a project built in Unity designed to explore a couple of ideas:
- Rubber Band AI in DDA
- Techniques of PCG
- The effect of DDA in PCG on player skill progression and engagement

The latest build of the final experiment is named Build_7 11-02-2017.
The raw data, processed data, and references used my final thesis are located in the Senior Thesis folder.
